CreateTemp creates a new temporary file in the directory dir, opens the file for reading and writing, and returns the resulting file. The filename is generated by taking pattern and adding a random string to the end. If pattern includes a "*", the random string replaces the last "*". The file is created with mode 0o600 (before umask). If dir is the empty string, CreateTemp uses the default directory for temporary files, as returned by TempDir. Multiple programs or goroutines calling CreateTemp simultaneously will not choose the same file. The caller can use the file's Name method to find the pathname of the file. It is the caller's responsibility to remove the file when it is no longer needed.
